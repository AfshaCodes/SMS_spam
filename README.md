# Spam Email Prediction Project

This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and feature extraction, combined with machine learning algorithms for classification. The project also includes a Streamlit app for real-time spam email prediction.

## Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and preprocesses email text (removing punctuation, stopwords, etc.).
   - Converts text into numerical features using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trains classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes) for spam detection.
   - Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. **Model Deployment**:
   - A Streamlit app allows users to input email text and receive predictions.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - Data processing and NLP: `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk`, `sklearn`
  - Deployment: `streamlit`

## How to Run

### Step 1: Setting up the Environment
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn streamlit
